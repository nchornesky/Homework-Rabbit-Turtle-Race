Codefellows Homework Adding a Human to the Race

Homework assignment for lesson about objects. 
I finally get the concept of an object. 
I don't get why we have three ways to write one. Though, I am sure that will become obvious in time--even if that's in 12 years. 
To make this race even more exciting, I have added a human and she always wins!
